# Certificate Fulfillment Operations

**Purpose & Outcome**  
Complete operational guide for certificate fulfillment, physical certificate management, and delivery processes. This ensures timely, accurate, and compliant certificate issuance while maintaining quality control and audit trails.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Admin access to fulfillment dashboard
- ✅ Certificate generation system access
- ✅ Inventory management system access
- ✅ Shipping and delivery system access

## Certificate Lifecycle

### Certificate States

**Lifecycle States**:

```
pending → generated → printed → shipped → delivered → archived
```

**State Transitions**:

- `pending` → `generated`: Certificate PDF created
- `generated` → `printed`: Physical certificate printed
- `printed` → `shipped`: Certificate mailed to student
- `shipped` → `delivered`: Certificate received by student
- `delivered` → `archived`: Certificate archived after retention period

### Certificate Types

**Digital Certificates**:

- Immediate PDF generation
- Email delivery to student
- Public verification URL
- QR code for verification

**Physical Certificates**:

- High-quality paper printing
- Tamper-evident features
- Professional presentation
- Tracking number for delivery

## Fulfillment Workflow

### Certificate Generation

**Automatic Generation**:

```bash
# 1. Student completes course requirements
# - Seat time completed
# - Final exam passed
# - All prerequisites met

# 2. System triggers certificate generation
# API endpoint: /api/certificates/generate
{
  "user_id": "user-uuid",
  "course_id": "course-uuid",
  "jurisdiction": "CA"
}

# 3. Certificate number assigned
# Database function: make_certificate_number('CA', '2025')

# 4. PDF certificate generated
# Using certificate template and student data

# 5. Certificate record created
INSERT INTO certificates (
  certificate_number,
  user_id,
  course_id,
  jurisdiction,
  completion_date,
  status,
  fulfillment_type
) VALUES (
  'CA-2025-000001',
  'user-uuid',
  'course-uuid',
  'CA',
  NOW(),
  'generated',
  'digital'
);
```

**Manual Generation**:

```bash
# 1. Admin initiates manual generation
# Admin Dashboard → Certificates → Generate Certificate

# 2. Verify student eligibility
SELECT * FROM enrollments
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
  AND course_id = 'course-uuid'
  AND status = 'completed';

# 3. Generate certificate
# Same process as automatic generation

# 4. Update fulfillment status
UPDATE certificates
SET status = 'generated',
    fulfillment_type = 'physical'
WHERE certificate_number = 'CA-2025-000001';
```

### Physical Certificate Printing

**Print Queue Management**:

```bash
# 1. Identify certificates for printing
SELECT
  certificate_number,
  student_name,
  course_name,
  completion_date
FROM certificates
WHERE status = 'generated'
  AND fulfillment_type = 'physical'
ORDER BY completion_date ASC;

# 2. Generate print batch
# Admin Dashboard → Fulfillment → Print Queue

# 3. Verify print data
# Check certificate numbers, student names, course details

# 4. Send to printer
# High-quality printer with certificate paper
```

**Print Quality Control**:

```bash
# 1. Verify print quality
# - Check for smudges or misalignment
# - Verify certificate numbers are clear
# - Ensure QR codes are scannable

# 2. Quality check checklist
# - [ ] Certificate number matches database
# - [ ] Student name spelled correctly
# - [ ] Course name is accurate
# - [ ] Completion date is correct
# - [ ] QR code scans properly
# - [ ] Digital signature is present

# 3. Update certificate status
UPDATE certificates
SET status = 'printed',
    printed_at = NOW()
WHERE certificate_number = 'CA-2025-000001';
```

### Shipping and Delivery

**Shipping Preparation**:

```bash
# 1. Prepare shipping materials
# - Certificate in protective sleeve
# - Cover letter with instructions
# - Return envelope (if required)
# - Tracking information

# 2. Verify shipping address
SELECT
  full_name,
  address_line_1,
  address_line_2,
  address_city,
  address_state,
  address_zip
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'user-uuid';

# 3. Generate shipping label
# Use shipping service API (USPS, FedEx, UPS)

# 4. Package certificate
# - Insert certificate in protective sleeve
# - Add cover letter
# - Seal package securely
# - Apply shipping label
```

**Shipping Process**:

```bash
# 1. Update certificate status
UPDATE certificates
SET status = 'shipped',
    shipped_at = NOW(),
    tracking_number = '1Z999AA1234567890'
WHERE certificate_number = 'CA-2025-000001';

# 2. Send tracking email
# Email student with tracking information

# 3. Monitor delivery
# Track package through shipping service

# 4. Confirm delivery
# Update status when package is delivered
UPDATE certificates
SET status = 'delivered',
    delivered_at = NOW()
WHERE certificate_number = 'CA-2025-000001';
```

## Inventory Management

### Certificate Supplies

**Required Materials**:

- Certificate paper (high-quality, tamper-evident)
- Protective sleeves
- Envelopes (standard and priority)

**Inventory Tracking**:

```bash
# 1. Track inventory levels
SELECT
  item_name,
  current_quantity,
  reorder_point,
  supplier
FROM fulfillment_inventory
WHERE current_quantity <= reorder_point;

# 2. Generate reorder alerts
# Admin Dashboard → Fulfillment → Inventory → Low Stock

# 3. Update inventory after use
UPDATE fulfillment_inventory
SET current_quantity = current_quantity - 1
WHERE item_name = 'certificate_paper';
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**Certificate Generation Failures**:

```bash
# 1. Check student eligibility
SELECT * FROM enrollments
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
  AND course_id = 'course-uuid';

# 2. Verify course completion
SELECT * FROM exam_attempts
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
  AND course_id = 'course-uuid'
  AND status = 'completed';

# 3. Check seat time requirements
SELECT * FROM seat_time
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
  AND course_id = 'course-uuid'
  AND total_minutes >= required_minutes;

# 4. Manual certificate generation
# Use admin interface to generate certificate manually
```

**Printing Issues**:

```bash
# 1. Check printer status
# Verify printer is online and has paper

# 2. Check certificate template
# Verify template file exists and is valid

# 3. Check certificate data
SELECT * FROM certificates
WHERE certificate_number = 'CA-2025-000001';

# 4. Re-print certificate
# Use admin interface to re-print certificate
```

**Shipping Issues**:

```bash
# 1. Check shipping address
SELECT * FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'user-uuid';

# 2. Verify tracking information
# Check shipping service website

# 3. Contact shipping service
# Call shipping service for package status

# 4. Re-ship if necessary
# Generate new shipping label and re-ship
```

### Emergency Procedures

**Certificate System Failure**:

```bash
# 1. Pause automatic generation
# Disable automatic certificate generation

# 2. Generate certificates manually
# Use admin interface for manual generation

# 3. Verify certificate integrity
# Check all generated certificates

# 4. Resume automatic generation
# Re-enable automatic certificate generation
```

**Printing System Failure**:

```bash
# 1. Switch to backup printer
# Use secondary printer if available

# 2. Generate digital certificates only
# Temporarily switch to digital-only fulfillment

# 3. Notify affected students
# Email students about temporary delay

# 4. Resume printing when fixed
# Return to normal printing operations
```

**Shipping System Failure**:

```bash
# 1. Hold certificates for shipping
# Pause shipping until system is restored

# 2. Notify affected students
# Email students about shipping delay

# 3. Resume shipping when fixed
# Process held certificates

# 4. Update tracking information
# Provide updated tracking to students
```

## Compliance and Audit

  c.shipped_at,
  c.delivered_at,
  c.tracking_number
FROM certificates c
WHERE c.certificate_number = 'CA-2025-000001';
```

### Quality Assurance

**Certificate Verification**:

```bash
# 1. Verify certificate data
SELECT
  certificate_number,
  student_name,
  course_name,
  completion_date,
  status
FROM certificates
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE;

# 2. Check for errors
SELECT
  certificate_number,
  student_name
FROM certificates
WHERE student_name IS NULL
