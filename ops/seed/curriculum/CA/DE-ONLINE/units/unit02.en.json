            "There are two main steering techniques: hand-over-hand and push-pull. Hand-over-hand steering is used for sharp turns and parking maneuvers. Push-pull steering is better for normal driving and gradual turns.",
            "For hand-over-hand steering, start with your hands at 9 and 3 o'clock. As you turn, let one hand slide up while the other hand crosses over to maintain control. This technique gives you maximum steering control.",
            "Push-pull steering is smoother and more efficient for most driving situations. Push up with one hand while pulling down with the other. This keeps your hands in the optimal position for quick reactions.",

            "At 20 mph, you need about 40 feet to stop. At 40 mph, you need about 120 feet. At 60 mph, you need about 240 feet. These distances increase significantly in poor weather.",
            "Your reaction time also affects stopping distance. If you're distracted, tired, or impaired, your reaction time increases dramatically. Always stay alert and focused on driving.",

            "The 3-second rule is a simple way to maintain safe following distance. Pick a fixed object ahead, like a sign or tree. When the vehicle in front of you passes it, count 'one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two, one-thousand-three.'",
            "If you reach the object before finishing the count, you're following too closely. Back off and try again. This rule works at any speed and gives you time to react if the vehicle ahead stops suddenly.",

            "Remember, the 3-second rule is a minimum. More distance is always safer, especially on highways or when traffic is heavy."
