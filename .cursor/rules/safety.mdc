# Safety
- Treat this repo as public: no PII, keys, or secrets.
- Changes to auth, payments, or certificate issuance must include a rollback plan.
- Migrations must be additive; avoid destructive DDL unless reviewed.
- Respect RLS. Do not bypass RLS from the client; use service role only in Edge Functions/n8n.
