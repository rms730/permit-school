- ✅ Compliance monitoring tools
- ✅ Security incident response procedures

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

**Application Layer**:

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting

**Authentication Layer**:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Strong password policies
- Session management
- JWT token security
- OAuth 2.0 integration

**Data Layer**:

- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Encrypted data at rest
- Encrypted data in transit
- Database access controls
- Audit logging

**Infrastructure Layer**:

- HTTPS everywhere
- WAF protection
- DDoS mitigation
- Network segmentation
- Security monitoring

### Security Controls

**Access Control**:

```sql
-- Row Level Security Policies
-- Users can only access their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Admins can access all data
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles
  FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
```

**Data Encryption**:

```bash
# Database encryption at rest
# Supabase automatically encrypts all data

# Data in transit encryption
# All connections use TLS 1.3

# Application-level encryption
# Sensitive data encrypted before storage
```

**Audit Logging**:

```sql
-- All operations logged with digital signatures
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  table_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  record_id UUID NOT NULL,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  old_data JSONB,
  new_data JSONB,
  performed_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  performed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  signature TEXT NOT NULL
);
```
